# DevRoomBan
Ban-Plugin Project for DevRoom Application

This plugin is being created as a test of my ability for DevRoom's application process for becoming a free-lancer. 
The purpose of this plugin is to replace the default ban system and replace it with a more modern solution that allows for banning and history saving on bans.
It uses MySQL to store data and has two main commands: /ban and /history
The deadline for this project is 3/9/2023
